"""
This empty __init__.py file serves several important purposes:

1. Package Declaration:
   - Marks this directory as a Python package
   - Enables Python to properly import modules from this directory
   - Required for pytest to correctly import and run tests

2. Module Import Support:
   - Allows other files to import modules using 'from app import ...'
   - Ensures proper module resolution in the project structure
   - Critical for test files to import application modules

3. Project Structure:
   - Maintains proper Python package structure
   - Follows Flask application best practices
   - Enables proper module discovery and import paths

Note: This file is intentionally empty as it only needs to exist to mark the directory
as a Python package. No initialization code is required at this level as the actual
application initialization is handled in app/__init__.py.
